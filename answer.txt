Discussion Questions Answers
=============================

1. How does CI/CD improve collaboration in ML teams?
---------------------------------------------------
CI/CD automates repetitive tasks like testing, training, and model evaluation. 
It ensures that all members work on consistent and tested codebases. 
This reduces manual errors, enables faster iteration, and increases transparency within ML teams.

2. What happens if the evaluation score is below a defined threshold?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If the evaluation score falls below the threshold, the pipeline can automatically fail 
or block the merge/deployment process. This prevents underperforming models from being deployed to production.

3. How can retraining or drift detection be integrated into this workflow?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Retraining or drift detection can be integrated by scheduling additional workflow triggers 
(e.g., daily or weekly) that check new incoming data or model performance metrics. 
If data drift or performance degradation is detected, the workflow can automatically 
start the retraining process using the same CI/CD steps.

4. What steps are needed to deploy this workflow to production (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To deploy to production, the following steps are needed:
- Create a Docker image using Dockerfile.serve and push it to a Docker registry.
- Configure a deployment job in the workflow to deploy the image to AWS ECS, GCP, or Kubernetes.
- Store cloud credentials and secrets securely in GitHub Actions.
- Optionally add a manual approval or CD (Continuous Deployment) stage after the CI process passes.
